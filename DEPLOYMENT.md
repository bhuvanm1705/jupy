## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check TypeScript errors
   - Verify import paths

2. **Deployment Fails**:

   - Verify Node.js version (18.x recommended)
   - Ensure all environment variables are set

3. **Games Not Working**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all components are properly imported
   - Test locally first

### Performance Optimization:
- Enable compression in hosting platform
- Use CDN for static assets
- Optimize images and assets
- Enable caching headers

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

- Real wallet integration shows balances but doesn't transfer actual funds
- All transactions are simulated for demo purposes
- Use HTTPS in production

## 📊 Analytics Setup

Add analytics to track usage:
1. Google Analytics
2. Vercel Analytics (if using Vercel)
3. Netlify Analytics (if using Netlify)
